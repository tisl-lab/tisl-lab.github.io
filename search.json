    "text": "Expectation of Confidentiality\nReasons for confidentiality include:\n\nensuring that ideators and early project contributors receive proper credit for their work before it is published and their names are clearly attached, and\nensuring the validity of double-blind review processes.\n\nExpectations are as follows:\n\n(Confidential channels) When discussing ideas 1:1 or in small group settings, whether via chat, in person, or on a call, do not assume without affirmative consent from someone that you are welcome to share their ideas with others. This means that you should ask if you wish to share, and if they do not agree, or if you have not asked, do not share their ideas or work with anyone.\n(Open channels) In any events advertised to and open to the general public, assume there is no confidentiality. If you are presenting or commenting at such an event: share only ideas, thoughts, and work that you are ok with being copied and modified by others. If you attend such an event and end up finding someone’s ideas or work valuable, feel free to share, but note that the fact that the channel is open does not recuse you from the responsibility to give them credit for their work! Scientific integrity requires that any sharing be prefaced with giving proper credit to the originator of the idea or work, just as with citing published papers."
